This script adds functionality for adding marks to OpenCPN.  When the script is run, it parks itself out of the way and you have the following functionality.

## _Copy position_ context menu

The _Copy position_ context menu copies the cursor position to your clipboard formatted ready for pasting into logs or reports.

## _Copy mark_ context menu

This copies a nearby waypoint to become the template for pasted marks.  You can click on the mark itself - at present this context menu will be in the _Main menu_ subsection.

Choose a mark with the desired icon, _Show at scale_  option and other attributes.

The copied mark becomes the pro forma style for pasted marks.

## _Paste mark_ context menu

Proposes to paste a mark at the chosen location using a previously copied mark as the style template.

When a mark is pasted, the chart is centred on it and will be zoomed in. if necessary, so that the mark is displayed.

This context menu is only available if you have previously copied a mark to be a template.

## _Paste mark from clipboard_ context menu

You can paste a mark at a position from some other source, such as a cruising guide.

Copy a position such as  _56째 48.190'N 010째 26.637'E_ to your clipboard and then select _Paste mark from clipboard_ in the context menu.  The script will propose to paste a mark at the location, the canvas centred there and the chart zoomed in if required so that the mark is displayed.

If there is text no longer than 15 characters before the position (e.g. _Sandy Bay 56째 48.190'N 010째 26.637'E_) this will be proposed as the mark name.

This context menu is only available if you have previously copied a mark to be a template.
